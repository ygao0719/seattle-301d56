# Code 301: Intermediate Software Development

Welcome to Code 301! This is a class that builds on your fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, git, and general web development, to prepare you for the deep dive of a Code 401 class.

# Introduction

We are going to learn about many different topics of web development. The overall structure of the course is based on Model-View-Controller (MVC), which is a common design pattern for web applications.

## Assignments

Lab-time code assignments follow each class time. Instructions for completing and submitting the assignments can be found in Canvas.

Assignments are submitted using a professional-grade Git-flow. If you haven't done so already, it's time to get comfortable with the core Git commands. Don't worry, we'll give you step by step help as needed.

## Assignments, Deadlines, Late Work, and other fun things
There are several types of assignments that are required for this course, and they have different policies on late work.

#### Complete/incomplete
* Readings: All readings are visible at the beginning of the course. Each reading is due by the start of the lecture that covers that reading, and locks (no late submissions) before the following lecture.
* Daily Journals: Each daily journal will become available 3 hours before lecture, and is due *and locks* at the start of lecture.
* Prework: You should have already finished this; if not, you should reach out to your instructor, and finish any remaining items ASAP.
* Career Coaching

#### Graded out of points
All assignments graded out of a number of points lose 20% automatically for late submissions. (Resubmits after an on-time submission do not incur this penalty.)

* Code Challenges: Each code challenge is released at 5pm, to be worked on that night. The code challenge is due the next day by the start of lecture. Code challenges lock the Sunday before project week.
* Labs: Each lab is released at 8:30am, and should be worked on during lab time. The lab is due by the start of lecture. Labs lock the Sunday before project week.
